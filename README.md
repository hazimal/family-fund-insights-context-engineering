# Context Engineering Project Template

Ready to start your project? **Just say "Let's begin"** and watch this framework transform your project management approach.

## 🤖 For AI Assistants: Auto-Start Instructions

When a user says **"Let's begin"**, immediately follow this sequence:

1. **Scan the folder** for all files using `LS` and `Read` tools
2. **Review the methodology** in `context_engineering_pm_approach.md`
3. **Study the discovery workflow** in `01_context_discovery_workflow.md`
4. **Analyze any user-provided context** (documents, briefs, emails, etc.)
5. **Create a TodoWrite list** for the 10-phase process
6. **Begin Phase 1** of the context discovery workflow immediately
7. **Identify gaps** in current context and start filling them systematically

### Key Behaviors:
- **Proactive Questioning**: Use the discovery workflow to guide comprehensive context gathering
- **Context Preservation**: Everything discovered gets documented and referenced
- **Gap Identification**: Actively find what's missing and ask targeted questions
- **Adaptive Flow**: Adjust questions based on user responses and uploaded materials
- **Continuous TodoWrite**: Track every phase and task throughout the process

### 📝 Critical Documentation Requirements:

**After Discovery (Phases 1-5):**
- Create `project_discovery_report.md` with comprehensive findings from all 5 phases
- Include all stakeholder responses, constraints, requirements, and context
- This enables starting fresh sessions with complete discovery context

**After Planning (Phases 6-7):**
- Create `project_planning_document.md` with detailed project brief and execution plans
- Include timeline, resources, risks, and all planning decisions
- This serves as the master execution reference for new sessions

**During Execution (Phases 8-10):**
- Create `project_status_report_[date].md` after each work session or milestone
- Include progress updates, decisions made, changes, and next steps
- Maintain continuous context for session handoffs and team alignment

## 🎯 What is Context Engineering?

Context Engineering applies systematic principles to project management by treating project context as foundational infrastructure that requires deliberate design. Instead of reactive task handling, this approach creates comprehensive understanding through structured discovery, planning, and execution phases.

## 🚀 How to Use This Template

### For Users:
1. **Add your context** to this folder (project briefs, emails, documents, requirements)
2. **Open Claude Code** or your preferred AI tool
3. **Simply say "Let's begin"**
4. **Answer questions** as the AI guides you through systematic discovery
5. **Receive comprehensive project plans** with full context preservation

### The AI will automatically:
- Scan and analyze all files in the folder
- Identify gaps in your project understanding
- Guide you through the 10-phase context engineering process
- Create comprehensive project documentation
- Generate an interactive project portal in dedicated folder structure
- Maintain context throughout the entire project lifecycle

## 🔄 The 10-Phase Auto-Process

The AI will guide you through these phases automatically:

### Discovery (Phases 1-5) - *AI will start here immediately*
1. **Core Project Definition**: Scope, objectives, timeline, budget
2. **Stakeholder & Organizational Context**: Roles, decisions, communication
3. **Technical & Resource Context**: Tools, assets, constraints
4. **Historical Context**: Past projects, lessons learned
5. **Risk Assessment & Success Criteria**: Potential obstacles, metrics

### Planning (Phases 6-7) - *AI transitions seamlessly*
6. **Context Synthesis & Project Brief**: Consolidate discovery into actionable foundation
7. **Context-Rich Project Planning**: Detailed execution roadmap with full context

### Execution (Phases 8-10) - *AI maintains context throughout*
8. **Context-Preserved Execution**: Execute while maintaining comprehensive context
9. **Iterative Context Refinement**: Continuously improve based on learnings
10. **Context Documentation & Handoff**: Close with comprehensive knowledge transfer

## 📋 What You'll Get

By the end of the process, you'll have:
- **Comprehensive Project Brief**: Complete context foundation
- **Detailed Project Plan**: Phase-by-phase execution roadmap
- **Interactive Project Portal**: Beautiful HTML dashboard for stakeholders
- **Risk Management Framework**: Proactive identification and mitigation
- **Team Alignment Documentation**: Clear roles and responsibilities
- **Communication Plan**: Structured stakeholder engagement
- **Success Metrics**: Measurable outcomes and validation criteria

### 📄 Generated Documentation Files:
- `project_discovery_report.md` - Complete discovery findings and context
- `project_planning_document.md` - Comprehensive project brief and execution plans
- `project_status_report_[date].md` - Regular progress and decision documentation
- `[project-name]-portal/index.html` - Interactive dashboard for stakeholders in dedicated folder

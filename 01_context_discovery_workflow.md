# Context Engineering Project Discovery Workflow

## Instructions for LLM
**Purpose**: Guide clients through comprehensive project discovery while maintaining engagement and avoiding question fatigue.

**Key Principles**:
- **Provide Options**: Offer 2-3 specific examples or possibilities with each question to spark thinking
- **Build on Responses**: Use previous answers to inform subsequent questions and reduce repetition
- **Conversational Flow**: Ask follow-up questions naturally rather than rigidly following the list
- **Batch Related Questions**: Group similar questions together to maintain momentum
- **Validate Understanding**: Summarize key points periodically to confirm comprehension
- **Adapt to Client**: Adjust language and examples based on client's industry and experience level

**Process Notes**:
- Not every question needs to be asked explicitly - some answers will emerge naturally
- Focus on gaps in understanding rather than checking every box
- Use the client's responses to prioritize which areas need deeper exploration
- End each phase with a brief summary before moving to the next

## Phase 1: Core Project Definition
**Goal**: Establish fundamental project parameters

**Questions**:
1. What exactly is this project? (scope, deliverables, components)
2. Who is the target audience? (demographics, psychographics, current situation)
3. What's the primary business objective? (revenue, leads, brand awareness, etc.)
4. What's the timeline? (hard deadlines, seasonal considerations, dependencies)
5. What's the budget range? (total budget, allocated across channels)

## Phase 2: Stakeholder & Organizational Context
**Goal**: Map all people, roles, and decision-making processes

**Questions**:
1. Who are all the internal stakeholders? (roles, responsibilities, decision authority)
2. Who are external partners/vendors? (current relationships, new needed)
3. How are decisions made? (approval processes, bottlenecks, final authority)
4. What's the communication preference? (tools, frequency, reporting style)
5. What's the team's capacity/bandwidth? (availability, competing priorities)

## Phase 3: Technical & Resource Context
**Goal**: Understand tools, systems, and operational constraints

**Questions**:
1. What systems/tools are currently in use? (marketing tech stack, integrations)
2. What are the technical limitations? (platform constraints, integration issues)
3. What assets already exist? (content, designs, lists, previous campaigns)
4. What resources are available? (in-house skills, budget for outsourcing)
5. What compliance/legal requirements exist? (industry regulations, brand guidelines)

## Phase 4: Historical Context
**Goal**: Learn from past experiences and establish patterns

**Questions**:
1. What similar projects have been done before? (outcomes, lessons learned)
2. What worked well in previous efforts? (successful strategies, processes, tools)
3. What challenges were encountered? (specific problems, how they were resolved)
4. What would you do differently next time? (process improvements, resource allocation)
5. What external factors influenced past projects? (market conditions, competition, timing)

## Phase 5: Risk Assessment & Success Criteria
**Goal**: Identify potential obstacles and define clear success metrics

**Questions**:
1. What could go wrong? (internal risks, external threats, dependencies)
2. What are the early warning signs? (metrics to monitor, checkpoints)
3. What contingency plans exist? (backup strategies, alternative approaches)
4. How will success be measured? (KPIs, qualitative indicators, timeline milestones)
5. What does "good enough" look like? (minimum viable outcomes, acceptable trade-offs)

## üìã Final Step: Create Discovery Report

**CRITICAL**: After completing all 5 phases, you MUST create a comprehensive discovery report that can be used to start fresh sessions with complete context.

### Create `project_discovery_report.md` with:

**Header Section:**
- Project name and brief description
- Discovery completion date
- Key stakeholders identified
- Project timeline and budget summary

**Phase 1: Core Project Definition**
- Detailed project scope and deliverables
- Target audience analysis
- Primary business objectives
- Timeline with key milestones and dependencies
- Budget breakdown and constraints

**Phase 2: Stakeholder & Organizational Context**
- Complete stakeholder mapping with roles and responsibilities
- Decision-making processes and approval workflows
- Communication preferences and protocols
- Team capacity and availability assessment
- External partner and vendor relationships

**Phase 3: Technical & Resource Context**
- Technology stack and system requirements
- Technical limitations and constraints
- Existing assets and resources inventory
- Resource gaps and procurement needs
- Compliance and regulatory requirements

**Phase 4: Historical Context**
- Previous project analysis and lessons learned
- Successful strategies and best practices
- Challenges encountered and resolution approaches
- Process improvements and recommendations
- External factors and market considerations

**Phase 5: Risk Assessment & Success Criteria**
- Comprehensive risk register with impact and probability
- Early warning indicators and monitoring metrics
- Contingency plans and mitigation strategies
- Success metrics and measurement criteria
- Minimum viable outcomes and trade-offs

**Summary & Next Steps:**
- Key insights and patterns identified
- Critical gaps or areas needing further exploration
- Recommended approach for planning phase
- Priority items for immediate attention

### File Format:
- Use clear headers and bullet points
- Include specific quotes and examples from stakeholder responses
- Organize information for easy reference during planning
- Ensure all context is preserved for future sessions
- Save as `project_discovery_report.md` in the project folder

### üêô GitHub Integration:
**After creating the discovery report, strongly recommend:**
1. **Create GitHub repository** if not already done: `[project-name]-context-engineering`
2. **Initial commit** with all discovery materials and this report
3. **Create discovery branch** for version control of discovery process
4. **Set up GitHub Issues** for tracking risks and action items identified
5. **Create project board** to visualize discovery findings and next steps

This document becomes the foundation for all future work and enables seamless session transitions.
